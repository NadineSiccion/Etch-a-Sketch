# Etch-a-Sketch
A web app made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript with functionality as priority. It is meant to emulate and Etch-a-Sketh board, with a few twists. Use a live demo [here](https://nadinesiccion.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/).

**This web app has the following features:**
- Hovering your mouse over a square in the grid will turn the square into a random color.
- Hovering over a square repeatedly will make the color darker until it turns black.
- Clicking on "Reset Board" will prompt the user to input a size for the sides of the board (default is 16).

**Limitations of this web app include:**
- Must be run on a desktop device, not yet mobile or tablet friendly.
- Sizing issue, user may need to zoom out to see the entire board and UI.
